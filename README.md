Summary
=======

Cake16 is a light color scheme for vim with mild contrast and not so many 
colors. It has a very pleasant yellowish tone and is great for prolonged coding.

It supports both gvim and 16-color terminals. Terminal support is done by 
mapping colors in terminal emulator settings, like 
[solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized).

Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install:

* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  * `git clone https://github.com/zefei/cake16 ~/.vim/bundle/cake16`

Usage
=====

After installation, add this line to your .vimrc:

    colorscheme cake16

If you are using gvim only, there's no more work. If you are using vim in 
terminals, open your terminal settings and map each color to the following 
table:

    UNIX color code           |  color hex value
    --------------------------+-----------------
    ANSI 0  (normal black)    |  #774f38
    ANSI 1  (normal red)      |  #b95942

If you are using iTerm2, you don't have to do this manually, just import colors 
from [iterm2/cake16.itermcolors](iterm2/cake16.itermcolors).
